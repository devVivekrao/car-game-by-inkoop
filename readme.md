### Intro

Hello! This is a task given me by inkoop. the problem was to build a simple console based car game.

### Points

- There is a car with 50L of petrol.
- It needs to travel from 0 to 100 KMs.
- The car moves in steps, at each step car can move between 0 KM to 6 KM (generate a random number).
- The car has a mileage of 0.5 KM/L.
- You can place 6 random petrol pumps on the road.
- Every time the car reaches the petrol pump exactly, the car gets a refill of 30 L.
- Write a JavaScript code to run this game and print every step of the car with the current position, petrol remaining.
- Add a button on the page "Start" which should start the game.
- Print the result of the game in the document window.
- If the start button is clicked again, it should clear the window and start the game again.
